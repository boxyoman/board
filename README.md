# The TINZ Evaluation Board
TINZ (or tinz) is a recursive acronym that stands for Tinz Is Not Zybo.
The reason for this naming is because Tinz is, in fact, not Zybo. This name was
invented by our good friend Ed Almasy. 

The purpose of the Tinz Eval Board (TEB, for more confusion) is to bring a half
decent FPGA/MCU development board to the world that can be use entirely with 
free software. 

As of now, the TEB is just a zygote swimming within our brains but will soon
be a reality. Check your local listings to see if Tinz near you!

DISCLAIMER: This is a INCA project (Is Not Calvert Approved), so be very 
cautious when speaking about this project near Penn College. You have been
warned.
