# The TINZ Development Board
TINZ (or tinz) is a recursive acronym that stands for Tinz Is Not Zybo.
The reason for this naming is because Tinz is, in fact, not Zybo. This name was
invented by our good friend Ed Almasy. 

As of now, the TINZ is just a zygote swimming within our brains but will soon
be a reality. 

DISCLAIMER: This is a INCA project (Is Not Calvert Approved), so be very 
cautious when speaking about this project near Penn College. You have been
warned.
