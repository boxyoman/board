#TINZ
This TINZ is an open source FPGA and CPU development board. It was born out of 
the dislike of the ZYBO board's development process, and the discovery of 
[Project IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/). With Project IceStorm we 
saw a way of developing that didn't involve huge convoluted IDEs, but rather 
simple command line utilities and whatever text editor you wanted. 

TINZ = TINZ Is Not ZYBO.
